Hello, I’m a scholar in the field of information and communication studies.  I research contemporary knowledge production practices, with a focus on how digital technologies shape and mediate them.  My most recent research work centers on knowledge production in the context of open science and public participation in science. I’m an Assistant Professor at the University of Maryland [College of Information Studies](https://ischool.umd.edu/). Previously, I was an Assistant Professor at the University of Michigan School of Information, where I taught ethics of information technologies and digital curation.
I’m also a Senior Research Fellow at the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics, and Public Policy, at the Harvard Kennedy School, where I co-founded the [Harvard Kennedy School Misinformation Review](https://misinforeview.hks.harvard.edu/) in 2019.
