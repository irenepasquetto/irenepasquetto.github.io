Hello, I’m a scholar in the field of information and communication studies. I research contemporary knowledge production, management and communication practices, with a focus on how these are mediated by digital technologies and data-driven reasoning. My most recent research work focuses on open science, digital curation of science artifacts, and public participation in science. I’m an Assistant Professor at the University of Maryland [College of Information Studies](https://ischool.umd.edu/). Previously, I was an Assistant Professor at the University of Michigan School of Information, where I taught ethics of information technologies and digital curation.
I’m also a Senior Research Fellow at the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics, and Public Policy, at the Harvard Kennedy School, where I co-founded the [Harvard Kennedy School Misinformation Review](https://misinforeview.hks.harvard.edu/) in 2019.
