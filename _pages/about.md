Hello, I’m a scholar in the field of information and communication studies. My most recent research work focuses on issues of science mis- and disinformation, open science practices, and public understanding and use/misuse of science products and infrastructures. I’ll be joining the faculty at the University of Maryland [College of Information Studies](https://ischool.umd.edu/) in January 2024. Previously, I was an Assistant Professor at the University of Michigan School of Information, where I taught ethics of information technologies and digital curation. I’m also a Senior Research Fellow at the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics, and Public Policy, at the Harvard Kennedy School, where I co-founded the [Harvard Kennedy School Misinformation Review](https://misinforeview.hks.harvard.edu/) in 2019.
